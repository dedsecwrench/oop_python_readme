# Classes

class is created using "class" keyword
anytime you use a class, you're basically creating objects.
and here is the word objects as in object oriented programming or OOP
you create objects from classes.

class is like a blueprint for a house or a class is like a mold.
an object is when you use that blueprint to build a specific house.

so the class is again, the definition of new data type
The object is the incarnation of or technically instantiation of.

and another term for object would actually be an instance
you have instances of classes as well

you can define you own class which is your own datatype iside of it, 
and using dot notation you can store attributes inside of it

className.attribute

Q. is class object mutable or immutable ?
A. they are mutable but we can make them immutable.

```
class ClassName:
      instance varibles
      attributes
      methods
```    
      
classes comes with certain methods and function inside of them that you can define and they just behave in a specific way.

These functions allow you tu determine behaviour in a standard way.

```
class ClassName:
      def __int__(self):
```      
        
Now inside of this "def __init__():" we can cutomize the class object.

This dunder init method is specifically known as instance method.
ans it's called exactly this "__init__" 
This is designed by the authors of Python.
and if you want to initialize the contents of an object from class, you define this method.
