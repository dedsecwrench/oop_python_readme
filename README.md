# Classes

class is created using "class" keyword
anytime you use a class, you're basically creating objects.
and here is the word objects as in object oriented programming or OOP
you create objects from classes.

class is like a blueprint for a house or a class is like a mold.
an object is when you use that blueprint to build a specific house.

so the class is again, the definition of new data type
The object is the incarnation of or technically instantiation of.

and another term for object would actually be an instance
you have instances of classes as well
